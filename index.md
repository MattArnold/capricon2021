# Welcome to Virtual Capricon

Thank you for joining us at our virtual convention, we're happy to have you here!

This website is only half of the convention. To experience the entire thing, you need to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Hra39Zkrhf). If you have not used Discord before, you will have best results if you visit discord.com and set up an account BEFORE attempting to join the Server. We also recommend downloading the app rather than using the website version. Note that you must have logged into Discord and accepted the Code of Conduct in order to participate in panel chat via the website.

### How to Use this Website

* Visit the [Schedule](/schedule) tab to find out what's on.
* Items are scheduled in rooms, just like at an in-person convention.
* Go to the room tab to attend the panel. If you have questions for the panelists, you can enter them into the chat window. Those chats also appear on the Discord.  If you'd like to continue the conversation after the panel, visit the Discord "hallway" channel associated with that room.
* Items taking place in [Maple](/maple), [Cafe](/cafe), [Gaming ](/gaming)and [Kids Program](/kids) happen directly in Zoom meetings. You will find direct links to those meetings on those pages.
* The [film room](/films) will host Capricon TV: KPRC-N, Channel 41! Check it out for a festival of old time Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror classics, as well as an assortment of new short films by some of the worldâ€™s best film makers.
* Don't forget to visit the artists and dealers you'll find in the [Art Show](/art-show) and [Dealers Room](dealers-room) - they are really struggling right now and need our support!
