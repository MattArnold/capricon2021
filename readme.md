If you're seeing this, you are staff of Capricon 2021. I added you as an editor of our Virtual NASFiC Access Portal. Forestry.io will serve as a content editing tool for the site. This cannot edit things like colors, layout, fonts, spacing, or other presentational design decisions. Just bold, italic, headlines, links, and lists. That is intentional. This is intended to create, update, and delete only content-- bare words and images. The layout and styling is handled by the site itself. If you would like any styling changes, please describe it to me (Matt Arnold matt.mattarn+capricon@gmail.com), and I will quickly implement it for you.

Your work here will be reflected on the site, typically with a delay of a minute or two. The site temporarily is at this domain:

https://mattarnold.github.io/capricon2021/

Please do not be shy at all about playing around with Forestry. You can't break anything that I cannot quickly roll back. You can add more pages to the site if you wish.

### Instructions

</section>

<section>

<img src="https://mattarnold.github.io/capricon2021/assets/images/forestry/forestry_sidebar.png" width="50%" style="" />

This is the Sidebar.

"Schedule Entries" and "Dealer Entries" are Collections of listings. We'll talk about that more below, after talking about Pages.

In "Pages", you can pick out which Page you wish to edit or create.

"Media" lets you upload images or other media assets to the site, so that you can use them when editing a page.

When you're creating or editing a Page, be sure to read and follow the explanatory instruction labels that I wrote on all these fields.

You can just type into this whole area, and select part or all of what you've typed. It's a typical text editor. The large font line at the top is part of the editor too. It's set to be a headline paragraph.

A quick way to create a bulleted list is to start a line with a dash, then a space.

<section>

<img src="https://mattarnold.github.io/capricon2021/assets/images/forestry/forestry_toolbar.png" width="66%" />

This toolbar will make your text selection in the editor into bold, italic, a hyperlink, or a list.

You can click the { } button to see some snippets I set up for you. Snippets are basically macros with some parts where you need to type in the specifics. Let me know if there are any repetitive bits of text that you would like me to set up as a snippet.

Click the image button to add an image. Remember that you need to upload your image by clicking "Media" in the Sidebar.

<section>

<img src="https://mattarnold.github.io/capricon2021/assets/images/forestry/forestry_save.png" width="50%" />

If we published a page, but you turn "Draft" to "ON", the page no longer appears on the site until we turn it back to "OFF".

If you click the little eye button, you go to another page called a Preview. It's a temporary version of the site which shows what your changes will look like.

If you do some work on a published page, but you don't want the work to appear on the site yet, don't turn on "Draft". Instead, just leave this editor without clicking the "Save" button. Never fear-- Forestry auto-saved your work. The next time you come back to the editor for this page, Forestry will ask you if you wish to restore your work here, or discard it.

Do you know Markdown? It's what you use when writing a Reddit comment, to add bold and italic and whatnot. This entire system is secretly converting your work to Markdown for you. If you prefer to type Markdown directly, click the three-dot symbol in the upper right, and from the menu, choose "Raw Editor".

### Collections

</section>

<section>

<img src="https://mattarnold.github.io/capricon2021/assets/images/forestry/forestry_collection_sidebar.png" width="50%" />

Click on a Collection in the Sidebar to create, edit, or delete individual scheduled events, or dealers, or whatever it is a Collection of.

A Collection is like a database that can appear in multiple places in the site. Right now, the Collection of Schedule events only is listed on the Schedule page, and the Collection of Dealers is only listed on the Dealers page. But we could do things like make a menu out of them, or list all the titles on a different page, or display them as a table, or export them as a spreadsheet, or whatever you ask me to implement. The Collection is where the data would come from.

If you want to add a Collection for a new kind of listing (for example Art Show pieces or Masquerade competitors), I can add it for you here.

If you want to change how the listings look, just ask me for it. If you want to bulk-create or bulk-edit a Collection, you can just send it to me in an email or a spreadsheet or whatever you like.

<section>

This button lets you add a new listing to the Collection you clicked in the Sidebar.

</section>

<section>

<img src="https://mattarnold.github.io/capricon2021/assets/images/forestry/forestry_collection_handle.png" width="50%" />

Each listing in the sidebar has a handle which you can drag up and down, to re-order of the listings in the Collection. For example, if events appear out of order in the Schedule, this is how you fix it.

Click on the title of a listing in a Collection to bring up a form where you can edit all of that listing's fields:
