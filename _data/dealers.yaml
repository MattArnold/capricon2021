  description: "After 31 years of service to fandom, Ray and Barb VanTilburg are retiring.
    \ We appreciate all of our customers so much.  Whatever con we've met at, you’ve
    been the people we wanted to work for and share this nerdy adventure with. \n
    \nAfter the horrible year we’ve all just lived through, we need to unlock the
    value of our dragon’s hoard of inventory.  We were so busy we didn’t know the
    meaning of the word “scale” as the business grew, but still built something special
    with the help of family and friends. \n \nWe’ve marked everything down by 50%
    with nothing held back, including con souvenirs from our wonderful licensors.
    \n \nWe are open to a sale of the business if you know someone, but it’s time
    to get moving toward whatever is waiting for us in 2021 and beyond.\n \nThank
    you for your business over the years.  To the artists, event staff and volunteers
    we’ve worked with, you have been a joy.  Together, we’ve produced a lot of smiles.\n"
