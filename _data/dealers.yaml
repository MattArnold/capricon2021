  description: "After 31 years of service to fandom, Ray and Barb VanTilburg are retiring.
    \ We appreciate all of our customers so much.  Whether we met at a Science Fiction,
    Gaming, Anime, Furry or Comic Con, you’ve been the people we wanted to work for
    and share this nerdy adventure with. \n \nAfter the horrible year we’ve all just
    lived through and the rolling disaster in Washington that’s unfolding while I
    write this, we need to unlock the value of our dragon’s hoard of inventory.  We
    were so busy we didn’t know the meaning of the word “scale” as the business grew,
    but still built something special with the help of family, friends and great employees
    from our little town of Sandwich, Illinois. \n \nWe’ve marked everything down
    by 50% with nothing held back, including convention souvenirs from our wonderful
    licensors. \n \nWhat does this mean in the short term?  Well, we still have staff
    and equipment to print or embroider for you while we work thru this process but
    we’re not adding new designs to our huge inventory.  Let us know how we can be
    of service and if we can do it sooner as opposed to later, we’ll be there for
    you.   \nWe are open to a sale of the business if you know someone, but it’s time
    to get moving toward whatever is waiting for us in 2021 and beyond.\n \nThank
    you for your business over the years.  To the artists, event staff and volunteers
    we’ve worked with, you have been a joy.  Together, we’ve produced a lot of smiles.\n"

    *Author Bio:* Peter Bremer is reference and instruction librarian at the University of Minnesota, Morris, a small college on the prairie in western Minnesota. He lives with my wife and furry dog at the corner where the sky and river meet. He believes that the world, on average, is a far better place with more nature in it, not less. When he's not in a library or writing he enjoys biking, playing tennis, and discovering new board games.

    *Publications:* His first novel, the fantasy Treetops, was self-published through Amazon KDP and is now available wherever good books are sold. To purchase autographed copies please email the author at the email address listed in the contacts.

    *Book Synopsis:* Teenager Jackie Ashmore is struggling with the passing of her mother when she receives an unexpected birthday gift that opens up a remarkable world where creatures from the past and the present coexist. Aided by unlikely animal allies and an aging guardian, Jackie embarks on a desperate rescue mission to save her little brother Dustin who has been kidnapped by a hooded rider and stolen across the clouds. Each step on Jackie's journey brings her one step closer towards a confrontation with a mysterious power named Samuel Flood, who is using Dustin for his own hidden purposes.

    With time running out and unbearable losses mounting, Jackie faces ever tougher choices that will determine not only the fate of her brother, but the Earth below as well.
