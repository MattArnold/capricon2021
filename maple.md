# Maple

Welcome to the Maple Room! Items in this room are more interactive, so are held in a Zoom meeting that you can join. Some items, like Kaffeeklatsches, are limited to a set number of people. You can sign up ahead of time for those, and if there's space, a Zoom link will be sent to you directly. For the rest, just click on the link at the time of the panel to join.
