Foreseeing the future is notoriously tricky. The pioneers of cellphone technology thought they were creating wireless telephones, not networked pocket computers. Attempts to dictate the future have been even less reliable.

**SF Media and the Goshwow Problem**

So often, our SF media focuses its attention on the flashy and the exciting rather than on critical explorations of the SF concepts that might help build a better world.

**Writing Same Sex Relationships**

Writing same-sex relationships has come into its own. You don't have to keep the slash zines under the table, and the Xena fans started their own publishing companies, and from there, mainstream publishers have realized that there's a market and started publishing same sex relationships in novels. This is for writers and readers of MM FF and poly variants, not to mention agender, ace, and etc - anything outside the traditional MF relationships.

**Upgrading Stories &amp; Society to the &quot;Penance Arc&quot;**

The United States is struggling with how people who have been harmed by those formerly in power should respond to fellow citizens who supported those leaders, with some demanding victims offer understanding and absolution in the name of &quot;healing.&quot; In this panel, we'll consider how the popular trope of &quot;Redemption Arcs&quot; can inform how we think about our present reality. Should we accept a redemption arc that ignores the idea of penance? What are meaningful acts of penance, both in the world we live in and the narratives we read and write? How does our experience as writers and readers help us respond to the demand to forgive and forget? (Jonathan Pessin, Tracy Townsend (m), Richard Garfinkle, Alessandra Kelley)

**Future of Accessibility**

One group that has benefited from the pandemic has been people with mobility challenges, who now found themselves on even footing with non-disabled people in a world that no longer requires leaving the house for work or to participate in many activities. At the same time, the move to online, visual based services has been difficult for many people with other kinds of disabilities. What have we learned and what should we be thinking about as we work to build a world everyone can participate in? (Marinda Darnell, Natalie Silk, Cacophonie Tamayo, W A Thomasson, S.N.Arly (m))

**Hopeful Science Fiction About Less Miserable Futures**

Science fiction has a long history of exploring our nightmares, from visions of capitalist hellscapes to dystopian totalitarian governments to gritty space colonization where everyone hates each other. But not all science fiction is about the Bad Stuff? Star Trek has given us one vision of a positive future for humanity. But what about some of the others? Where are the hopeful futures in SF worlds? What dream visions get you excited about what could be? (Wendy Van Camp, Casella Brookins (m), Sarah Pinsker, Tracy Townsend)

**Future of Publishing**

Publishing in 2020 hit crisis mode. With bookstores closed and book sales down by as much as 70% in some markets, authors, publishers and the rest of the industry are wondering what is going on and what to do. Is anyone reading anymore? Panelists will discuss the current state and their hope for the future. The answer to the publishing problem isn't inside the box--but what is it? This panel's focus is not on the publishing world's current or probable future state, but rather on what we as professionals in this world would like publishing to be in the future.
